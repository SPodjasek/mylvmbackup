This directory contains the previous tagged versions of mylvmbackup,
when the code was still maintained in Subversion. Since the source tree
has been moved to Bazaar, tags are maintained as bzr tags, not by
creating new subdirectories in here. You can use "bzr tags" to see
all available tags, "bzr clone -r tag:<tag>" to branch from a certain
tagged version.
