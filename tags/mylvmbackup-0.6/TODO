mylvmbackup TODO list:

 - Document the new logging options in the man page and help output
 - Make backing up of my.cnf optional, verify that the file actually exists
   before copying it
 - Modularize the backup portion
 - Support other backup methods than tar after modularizing
     * rsync - http://rsync.samba.org/ (already available as a hack, add
       support for remote backups)
     * rsnapshot - http://www.rsnapshot.org/
     * duplicity - http://duplicity.nongnu.org/
     * unison - http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/
     * zip - http://www.info-zip.org/Zip.html
 - Allow splitting of archives. Could this be done by being able to modularize
   the backup part and allowing multiple plugins in a pipe? E.g. a generic
   splitting plugin that can split any archives.
 - Ability to exclude the binlog/relay log
 - Further clean up the code, better option and error handling
 - Providing an option to shut down the server instead of using FLUSH TABLES
   WITH READ LOCK before taking the snapshot, for consistent InnoDB snapshots
   (e.g. on a replication slave)
 - Allow running custom scripts before/after each phase: (flush, lvcreate,
   mount, recover, backup, umount)
