mylvmbackup TODO list:

 - Document the new logging options in the man page and help output
 - Support other backup methods than tar (e.g. rsync) by modularizing the backup part
 - Further clean up the code, better option and error handling
 - Providing an option to shut down the server instead of using FLUSH TABLES
   WITH READ LOCK before taking the snapshot, for consistent InnoDB snapshots
   (e.g. on a replication slave)
