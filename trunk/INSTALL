Installation of mylvmbackup is pretty straight-forward:

 - Put the script "mylvmbackup" in a directory listed in your $PATH environment
   variable (e.g. /usr/local/bin) and make sure it's executable
 - If required, put the man page into a directory listed in your $MANPATH environment
   variable (e.g. /usr/local/man/man1)

Thank's it!
