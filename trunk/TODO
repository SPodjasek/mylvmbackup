mylvmbackup TODO list:

 - Support other backup methods than tar (e.g. rsync) by modularizing the backup part
 - Further clean up the code, better option and error handling
 - Better logging (via syslog?)
 - Convert the separate man page into POD or another documentation meta format to
   simplify the creation of READMEs, man pages and related documents?
