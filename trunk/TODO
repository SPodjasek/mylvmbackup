The mylvmbackup TODO list is now maintained as "Blueprints" on Launchpad:

  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/mylvmbackup


 - Ability to exclude the binlog/relay log
 - Providing an option to shut down the server instead of using FLUSH TABLES
   WITH READ LOCK before taking the snapshot, for consistent InnoDB snapshots
   (e.g. on a replication slave)
 - RPM packaging: fix Requires for distributions (e.g. perl-Config-IniFiles)
