mylvmbackup TODO list:

 - Document the new logging options in the man page and help output
 - Support other backup methods than tar (e.g. rsync) by modularizing the backup part
 - Further clean up the code, better option and error handling
 - Add an option "--skip-flush-tables" that performs the snapshot without
   flushing the tables to disk beforehand (which does not work for InnoDB
   tables anyway)
 - Providing an option to shut down the server instead of using FLUSH TABLES
   WITH READ LOCK before taking the snapshot, for consistent InnoDB snapshots
   (e.g. on a replication slave)
