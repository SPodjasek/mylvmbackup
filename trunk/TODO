mylvmbackup TODO list:

 - Improve the InnoDB recovery function: create a separate my.cnf for the
   server instance that performs the recovery on the snapshot, including the
   InnoDB-related parameters from the main my.cnf file (particularly table spaces,
   log files) as well as other options (e.g. sane buffer sizes)
   (Maybe the script could just parse the original my.cnf file for the related
   options and add these to the mysqld_safe call?)
 - Investigate further about the need of calling xfs_freeze prior to taking
   the snapshot when using XFS file systems. According to the docs, this is
   not needed when using LVM2 (and may even lead to deadlocks), but may be
   needed for LVM1 (without the VFS-lock patch). How could this be detected
   automatically? How to snapshot file systems that support storing log files
   on separate block devices?
 - Modularize the backup portion
 - Support other backup methods than tar after modularizing
     * rsync - http://rsync.samba.org/ (already available as a hack, needs
       some cleanups/improvements)
     * rsnapshot - http://www.rsnapshot.org/
     * duplicity - http://duplicity.nongnu.org/
     * unison - http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/
     * zip - http://www.info-zip.org/Zip.html
 - rsync backup: allow backing up into the same directory (no time stamps),
   to increase backup speed (using the differential capabilities of rsync)
 - rsync backup: support the --link-dest option, to preserve disk space on
   the backup drive
 - tar backup: check if the "z" option is used for tar, change the archive
   name suffix accordingly (.tar.gz vs. .tar)
 - Support other snapshot options in addition to LVM snapshots (e.g. Sun's ZFS
   snapshots/clones)
 - Allow splitting of archives. Could this be done by being able to modularize
   the backup part and allowing multiple plugins in a pipe? E.g. a generic
   splitting plugin that can split any archives.
 - Ability to exclude the binlog/relay log
 - Further clean up the code, better option and error handling
 - Providing an option to shut down the server instead of using FLUSH TABLES
   WITH READ LOCK before taking the snapshot, for consistent InnoDB snapshots
   (e.g. on a replication slave)
 - RPM packaging: fix Requires for distributions (e.g. perl-Config-IniFiles)
