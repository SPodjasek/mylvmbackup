mylvmbackup TODO list:

 - Document the new logging options in the man page and help output
 - Support other backup methods than tar by modularizing the backup part:
     * rsync - http://rsync.samba.org/
     * rsnapshot - http://www.rsnapshot.org/
     * duplicity - http://duplicity.nongnu.org/
     * unison - http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/
     * zip - http://www.info-zip.org/Zip.html
 - Further clean up the code, better option and error handling
 - Add an option "--skip-flush-tables" that performs the snapshot without
   flushing the tables to disk beforehand (which does not work for InnoDB
   tables anyway) - this would save time, as the flushing can take some time,
   depending on the buffer sizes
 - Providing an option to shut down the server instead of using FLUSH TABLES
   WITH READ LOCK before taking the snapshot, for consistent InnoDB snapshots
   (e.g. on a replication slave)
