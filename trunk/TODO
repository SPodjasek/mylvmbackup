mylvmbackup TODO list:

 - add support for creating a configuration file /etc/mylvmbackup.conf to store the
   backup options (using Config::IniFiles, Config::General or even YAML?)
 - Support other backup methods than tar (e.g. rsync) by modularizing the backup part
 - Further clean up the code, better option and error handling
 - Better logging (via syslog?)
 - Convert the separate man page into POD or another documentation meta format to
   simplify the creation of READMEs, man pages and related documents?
