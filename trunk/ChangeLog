 - Added initial support for using an external /etc/mylvmbackup.conf
   configuration file (requiring the Config::IniFiles Perl module)

2006-11-21  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - Removed the START/STOP SLAVE calls (They cause problems where the box isn't
   a slave, and don't actually help anything where the box is a slave) - thanks
   to Robin H. Johnson <robbat2@gentoo.org> for reporting this and Fred Blaise
   for verifying it.

 - Added Makefile to perform various build and installation tasks
 - Renamed the mylvmbackup source file to mylvmbackup.pl.in, which
   is turned into the mylvmbackup executable by the Makefile
 - Added RPM spec file to build RPM packages
 - Updated Version to 0.2 (now defined in the Makefile)
 - Updated INSTALL file, now one can run "make install" instead of manually
   copying the files
 - Updated TODO list

2006-11-14  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - Documented Robin's changes in the man page, cleaned up the man page
   in general
 - Added new option: 'datefmt' that allows one to define the format of
   the date time stamp in the backup file name

2006-11-12  Robin H. Johnson <robbat2@gentoo.org>

 - General cleanup, intended to make mylvmbackup usable for distributions.
 - Add --xfs to help with using XFS snapshots (adds nouuid per LVM HOWTO)
 - Support for relative paths within the datadir LV.
 - Sane default locations for the snapshot mount point and the backup
   directory. Distributions should create /var/tmp/mylvmbackup/mnt/ and
   /var/tmp/mylvmbackup/backup/ on installation of mylvmbackup.
 - Add a prefix name for backups, to enable multiple parallel backups.
 - Add host/port/socket support for connecting to MySQL properly.
 - Give a little more output during the backup process.
 - Change the position file format to be a key/value pair style.
 - Capture the slave and master status during position capture.
 - Hidden option: 'tararg' to override the default 'cvzf' parameter to tar.
 - Hidden option: 'backuplv' to control the name of the snapshot LV.
