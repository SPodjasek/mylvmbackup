 - Applied patch from Marc Haber: added option "--keep_snapshot" that will
   skip the removal of the backup snapshot before terminating the script.
   Providing the option "--backuptype=none" will now skip creating a backup
   using the builtin backup modules. Both option provide more flexibility
   when using hooks for performing the actual backup tasks.
 - Added two new hooks: "backupsuccess" and "backupfailure" which are called
   respectively upon success of failure of the backup operation
 - Updated documentation

 - Make sure that binaries are being found ($PATH may not include /sbin when
   called from cron), added missing entry for "lvs" to mylvmbackup.conf

2008-07-10  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - Applied patch from Patrick Hahn: provide an option to call external
   scripts/applications (hooks) at various stages of the backup
   process. See the man page for instructions
 - Added options "--skip_hooks" to disable the execution of hooks and
   "--hooksdir" to define the location for these (default is
   /usr/share/mylvmbackup)
 - Updated documentation: added new options and instructions on how
   to use hooks
 - Updated TODO

2008-07-09  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - Applied patch from Robin H. Johnson: Full support for an rsync:// service
   as the backup destination. If you include any path fragments with the rsync
   module name, they must already exist!
 - Updated documentation to reflect this change

2008-06-25  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - The mylvmbackup source tree was moved from Subversion to Bazaar and is now
   hosted on Launchpad.net: 

2008-04-10  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - Bumped up version number to 0.9

2008-04-09  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - Fixed a bug in the InnoDB recovery function: the second mysqld process
   clobbered the socket file of the primary MySQL instance
   (thanks to Alain Hoang for reporting this)
 - Updated the man page, noted some other limitations of the InnoDB recovery
   function

2008-04-04  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - Bumped up version number to 0.8

2008-03-03  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - Bug fix: use the correct mysqld parameter to provide an alternative PID
   file (--pid-file instead of --pidfile) - thanks to Guillaume Boddaert and
   Jim Wilson for reporting this!
 - Added option "--skip_mycnf" to skip including a copy of the MySQL
   configuration file in the backup, added a safety check that the file
   actually exists prior to backing it up.

2007-10-27  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - Bumped up version number to 0.7

2007-10-27  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - Use mktemp/mkdtemp to generate the random temporary file/directory names

2007-10-27  Robin H. Johnson <robbat2@gentoo.org>

 - Add rsync backup type. This is very useful if you want to use mylvmbackup to
   create the initial state for your slave servers.
 - Shrink the --help output by only listing common options, and referring the
   user to the manpage for further information.

2007-10-20  Robin H. Johnson <robbat2@gentoo.org>

 - Add support for a trailing argument to tar, can be used for excluding
   files.
 - Clean up variable ordering and manpage to ensure that all
   arguments/configopts are documented.
 - Do not start NDB or a replication slave when performing InnoDB recovery
 - Seperate out the suffix of the tarball (Preperation for rsync and users
   that want to use bzip2 or no compression.)
 - Use a temporary suffix at the end of the tar backup file to indicate that
   it is incomplete.
 - Applied patch from Robin H. Johnson: Include the my.cnf file in the backup.
   (TODO: make this optional and check for the existence of the file before
   copying it)
 - Add the ability to run an extra FLUSH TABLES for busy databases where
   lvcreate might take a long time (and may overrun the interactivity timeout
   on the connection, losing the lock).

2007-09-13  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - Added option "--pidfile" to provide an alternative PID file location for
   the second server instance that is started to perform the InnoDB recovery
   on the snapshot prior to backing it up (Otherwise it may default to using
   the same pid file location that the running server uses and safe_mysqld
   will abort) - thanks to Kristian KÃ¶hntopp for making me aware of this
   problem
 - Before discarding the snapshot LV, the output of "lvs <snapshot>" is now
   printed out for diagnostics. It contains useful information like "how much
   percent of the backing store was used, which helps tuning the size of the
   snapshot LV.
 - Updated the man page, documented the new pidfile option and added a section
   with general hints

2007-07-03  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - Added option "--skip-flush-tables" that performs the snapshot without
   flushing the tables to disk beforehand (which is not supported by InnoDB
   tables anyway) - this would save time, as the flushing can take some time,
   depending on the buffer sizes. (Thanks to Peter Zaitsev for the suggestion)

2007-05-31  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - Bumped up version number to 0.6
 - Updated man page and README to list all required Perl modules
   (thanks to Scott Kaminiski for pointing this out)
 - Replaced the call to the external /bin/date binary for creating
   the timestamp string with a builtin function (using Date::Format)

2007-05-07  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - Bumped up version number to 0.5
 - Slightly reworked Eric's patch and performed some minor code cleanup
 - Documented the InnoDB recovery option in the man page

2007-04-12  Eric Bergen <eric@provenscaling.com>

 - Added Option "--innodb-recover", which provides an option to run InnoDB
   recovery on LVM2 snapshots (which provide write access to the device) prior
   to creating the backup archive. This speeds up resuming a MySQL instance
   from a restored backup. Also fixed a bug with the default value handling
   for command line options. In version 0.4 if a config file was specified
   default values in the script were all changed to blank. This means that
   the config file had to supply values for every variable instead of just
   the values that need to be changed from default.

2007-01-14  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - Bumped up version number to 0.4
 - Fixed DSN string handling (thanks to Peter Zaitsev for spotting this)
 - removed a few unused configuration options from the config file (we can
   re-add them once they are really used)
 - Slightly cleaned up Robin's changes, updated the man page and help output
 - Fixed logging to the console (log levels were not printed)

2007-01-12  Robin H. Johnson <robbat2@gentoo.org>

 - Clean up option handling to load the defaults, followed by the default
   configuration file, followed by an alternative configuration file
   (specified via CLI arguments), followed by the remainer of the CLI
   arguments.
 - Do cleanups on directory inputs for spaces and trailing slashes.
 - Enforce a non-empty prefix at all times.
 - Change the capture of the position file and tarball creation to not use
   absolute pathes, and instead use them relative to $mountdir.
 - Utilize a bindmount to get the position directory near the $mountdir for
   the tarball creation.
 - 'use vars' has been deprecated by upstream way back in Perl-5.6.0
   http://perldoc.perl.org/vars.html, use 'my' instead.

2006-11-24  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - Cleaned up Fred's patch a bit: added --help output and corrected the option
   handling. Provide sane default values when no option file is used.
 - Only require SyS::Syslog if we actually use syslog for logging (less
   Perl module dependencies)
 - Slightly beefed up the console logging by printing a time stamp in front
   of the message and display "Info/Warning/Error/" according to the log
   level.
 - Removed syslog_ident and syslog_args from the command line options and
   config file (these remain hardcoded)
 - added check for hostname, if remote logging is requested
 - Updated and reformatted the help output
 - Changed the name of the default logging from "standard" to "console"
 - Added descriptions of the new logging options to the man page
 - Released as version 0.3

2006-11-23  Fred Blaise <fred.blaise@gmail.com>

 - Added functionality to use syslog for logging activity. This requires
   the Sys::Syslog Perl module.
 - Bugfix: in GetOptions, tar and umount were pointing to the mount binary.
 - Do not append a '/' to $mountdir if $prefix is empty.
 - Bugfix: Corrected variable 'date_format' back to 'datefmt'
 - Bugfix: Removed tailing slash for backupdir and mountdir in config file to
   avoid resulting double slash with unused variable
 - Bugfix: Fixed wrong section assignation of $prefix (misc, instead of lvm),
   which resulted in uninitialized value.

2006-11-23  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - slighty cleaned up Fred's patch, reverted using the previous default values
   and match the variables used in the config file with the command line
   options
 - Updated TODO (supporting external config files is done, thanks)
 - bumped up version number to 0.3
 - Added installing of the config file to the Makefile
 - Changed the default LVM snapshot size from 10M to 5G to match the defaults
 - Added the config file to the RPM file list
 - Changed the script to still work without the configfile, falling back to
   builtin defaults (to revert the previous behavior).
 - Started converting the man page to asciidoc for easier maintenance and
   more possibilities to convert to other formats like HTML or DocBook.
 - Renamed the man page input file, added man page building with a2x to the
   Makefile

2006-11-22  Fred Blaise <fred.blaise@gmail.com>

 - Added initial support for using an external /etc/mylvmbackup.conf
   configuration file (requiring the Config::IniFiles Perl module)

2006-11-21  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - Removed the START/STOP SLAVE calls (They cause problems where the box isn't
   a slave, and don't actually help anything where the box is a slave) - thanks
   to Robin H. Johnson <robbat2@gentoo.org> for reporting this and Fred Blaise
   for verifying it.

2006-11-15  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - Added Makefile to perform various build and installation tasks
 - Renamed the mylvmbackup source file to mylvmbackup.pl.in, which
   is turned into the mylvmbackup executable by the Makefile
 - Added RPM spec file to build RPM packages
 - Updated Version to 0.2 (now defined in the Makefile)
 - Updated INSTALL file, now one can run "make install" instead of manually
   copying the files
 - Updated TODO list
 - Released as version 0.2

2006-11-14  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - Documented Robin's changes in the man page, cleaned up the man page
   in general
 - Added new option: 'datefmt' that allows one to define the format of
   the date time stamp in the backup file name

2006-11-12  Robin H. Johnson <robbat2@gentoo.org>

 - General cleanup, intended to make mylvmbackup usable for distributions.
 - Add --xfs to help with using XFS snapshots (adds nouuid per LVM HOWTO)
 - Support for relative paths within the datadir LV.
 - Sane default locations for the snapshot mount point and the backup
   directory. Distributions should create /var/tmp/mylvmbackup/mnt/ and
   /var/tmp/mylvmbackup/backup/ on installation of mylvmbackup.
 - Add a prefix name for backups, to enable multiple parallel backups.
 - Add host/port/socket support for connecting to MySQL properly.
 - Give a little more output during the backup process.
 - Change the position file format to be a key/value pair style.
 - Capture the slave and master status during position capture.
 - Hidden option: 'tararg' to override the default 'cvzf' parameter to tar.
 - Hidden option: 'backuplv' to control the name of the snapshot LV.

2006-05-05  Lenz Grimmer <lenz@grimmer.com>

 - Initial version 0.1
 - Moved out of the internal BK repository, added GPL license and additional info
