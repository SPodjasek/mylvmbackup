Installation of mylvmbackup is pretty straight-forward:

Extract the tarball and enter the created directory:

    tar zxvf mylvmbackup-<version>.tar.gz
    cd mylvmbackup-<version>

Install the program and man page:

  make install

By default, the files will be installed in the /usr/local directory
hierarchy. You can override this using the "prefix" variable, e.g.:

  make prefix=/usr install

To remove the files, simply run:

  make uninstall

That's it! See the README and manual page for more info on how to use
mylvmbackup.
