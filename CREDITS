Several people have contributed to the script since it has been released.
See the ChangeLog for more details.

Robin H. Johnson from the Gentoo project cleaned up the code and added
several useful features, e.g. rsync backup support.

Fred Blaise contributed the initial support to use an external
configuration file and logging via syslog.

Eric Bergen provided the code that performs the InnoDB recovery prior
to performing the backup of LVM2 snapshot volumes. He also fixed the
broken handling of default options.

Kristian Köhntopp suggested the '--pidfile' option and to add the output
of the LVM statistics for being able to better tune the snapshot size.

Marc Haber provided a patch for keeping snapshots and using "none"
as a backup type.

Patrick Hahn provided an option to call external scripts/applications
(hooks) at various stages of the backup process.

Matt Lohier submitted the patch to support rsnap as a backup backend.

Matthew Boehm contributed a patch to make the backup file name suffix
configurable via a "--suffix" option and also converted the documentation
from asciidoc to Perl POD. He also contributed a patch to improve the
error handling in case of a failed database connection and support for using
date/time format strings in the backupdir and mountdir path names.
Matthew also provided patches that enabled the use hooks written as Perl
modules.

Alexander Skwar contributed a patch to support backups using different
compression methods other than gzip for the tar backup as well as support
for using a non-GNU tar for the archiving.

"kjetilho" (https://launchpad.net/~kjetilho-ifi) contributed a patch
to improve the robustness and error handling of the entire script.
(Bug #298175)

Tim Stoop provided a patch to enable the --keep-mount option.

Baron Schwartz provided a patch to allow reading the username and
password from ~/.my.cnf

Ronald Bradford provided many helpful suggestions to improve the
usability and robustness of the script.

Ask Bjørn Hansen contributed a patch to allow targets not to have a
timestamp (for rsync targets, for example) and a documentation fix.

Ben Bonnell contributed a patch to add support for providing rsync
options for the rsnap backend.

Klaus Ethgen contributed a patch that removes the annoying LVM
warnings about a leaked file descriptor (DBD:mysql does not add
FD_CLOEXEC on the MySQL socket, requires DBD::mysql 4.019 and above)

Alexandre Anriot contributed patches to provide the mail reporting
method, which sends the log output via email as well as the "purge"
action and "backupretention" option that allows to only keep a
defined number of previous backups in the backup directory.
