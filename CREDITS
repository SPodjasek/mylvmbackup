several useful features, e.g. rsync backup support.

Fred Blaise contributed the initial support to use an external
configuration file and logging via syslog.

Eric Bergen provided the code that performs the InnoDB recovery prior
to performing the backup of LVM2 snapshot volumes. He also fixed the
broken handling of default options.

of the LVM statistics for being able to better tune the snapshot size.

(hooks) at various stages of the backup process.

Matt Lohier submitted the patch to support rsnap as a backup backend.

Matthew Boehm contributed a patch to make the backup file name suffix
configurable via a "--suffix" option and also converted the documentation

error handling in case of a failed database connection and support for using
date/time format strings in the backupdir and mountdir path names.
Matthew also provided patches that enabled the use hooks written as Perl
modules.
